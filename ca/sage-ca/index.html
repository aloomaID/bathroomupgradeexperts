Spa-Like Features<br>Incorporating elements like freestanding bathtubs, rainfall showers, and wellness-oriented features like chromatherapy is becoming a popular choice in Sage California . These additions transform the bathroom into a private oasis, perfect for relaxation and rejuvenation.<br>5. Minimalist and Clean Designs<br>The trend of minimalism continues to rise in 2024, with streamlined cabinetry, floating vanities, and clean lines creating bathrooms that feel spacious and serene. The focus is on decluttered, functional spaces that prioritize comfort and ease.<br>These trends reflect the growing desire for bathrooms in Sage California  to serve as both functional spaces and personal sanctuaries.
