            <h3>Oak Park, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>This area was designated as within Royal Oak Township; it was first settled by European Americans in 1840, but remained sparsely populated for many decades following. The first major housing development was constructed in 1914 at the time of World War I, when the township sold land to the Majestic Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision. The subdivision was incorporated as a village on May 3, 1927. Two petition drives during the Great Depression to dissolve the village government and return it to the township, citing 'excessively high cost of village government,' failed in 1931 and 1933. The village incorporated as a city on October 29, 1945, following the end of World War II.</p>
