                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Butler Beach is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Johns County, Florida, United States. The population was 4,978 at the time of the 2020 United States Census. Established by Frank B. Butler, who had been successful operating a grocery store and became a political activist, it was a resort for African Americans. The Lincolnville businessman bought land in the area between the Atlantic Ocean and the Matanzas River, and offered beach access to African Americans. It was the only beach open to them between Jacksonville and Daytona Beach.</p>
