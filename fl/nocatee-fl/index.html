            <h3>Nocatee, FL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Nocatee /ˈnɒkətiː/ is an unincorporated planned community located primarily in northern St. Johns County, Florida and a census-designated place (CDP). The community blends a variety of neighborhoods with schools, parks, recreation, offices, shopping, and restaurants. As of 2020, the community consists of twenty-two neighborhoods, some of which are specialized for certain age groups. Part of the development lies within Jacksonville in Duval County. It is near Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida's First Coast region and sits on 13,323 acres (5,392 ha) of land. It was approved in 2001 as a Development of Regional Impact (DRI) under Section 380.06 of the Florida Statutes. In addition, Nocatee is just a few minutes away from pristine beaches, golf courses, business parks and major airports in downtown Jacksonville and St. Augustine. The Nocatee vision was centered around a desire to transform the unique setting of the land into a place with a truly exceptional quality of living, while still preserving the area's peaceful beauty. By incorporating elements of 'Smart Growth,' Nocatee provides its residents with employment opportunities, shopping, schools, recreation, and beautiful homes - everything needed for an exceptional quality of life.</p>
