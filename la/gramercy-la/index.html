            <h3>Gramercy, LA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Gramercy was originally an American Indian and French settlement and trading post. In 1739, much of the area which is now known as Gramercy was sold to Joseph Delille Dupart, Commissioner of Indian Nations under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville. The town was incorporated in November 1947. A historic sugar mill was established in Gramercy in 1895, which became the Colonial Sugar Refinery in 1902. The National Park Service has designated the site as the Colonial Sugar National Historic District.</p>
