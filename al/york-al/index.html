            <h3>York, AL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>York is a city in Sumter County, Alabama, United States. Founded around 1838 after the merging of two communities, Old Anvil and New York Station, the latter a station on a stagecoach line. The rail came through in the 1850s and later, the 'New' was dropped from York Station in 1861. With the discovery that another community in Alabama bore that name, the 'Station' was dropped and York was formally incorporated on April 6, 1881. At the 2010 census the population was 2,538, down from 2,854 in 2000. From 1920 to 1980, it was the largest town in the county. Since 1990, it has been the second largest city behind the county seat of Livingston.</p>
