These additions transform the bathroom into a private oasis, perfect for relaxation and rejuvenation.<br>5. Minimalist and Clean Designs<br>The trend of minimalism continues to rise in 2024, with streamlined cabinetry, floating vanities, and clean lines creating bathrooms that feel spacious and serene.
